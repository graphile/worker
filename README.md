Job queue for PostgreSQL running on Node.js - allows you to run jobs (e.g.
sending emails, performing calculations, generating PDFs, etc) "in the
background" so that your HTTP response/application code is not held up. Can be
used with any PostgreSQL-backed application. Pairs beautifully with
[PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/).

## Quickstart: CLI

In your existing Node.js project:

### Add the worker to your project:

```
yarn add graphile-worker
# or: npm install --save graphile-worker
```

### Create tasks:

Create a `tasks/` folder, and place in it JS files containing your task specs.
The names of these files will be the task identifiers, e.g. `hello` below:

```js
// tasks/hello.js
module.exports = async (payload, helpers) => {
  const { name } = payload;
  helpers.logger.info(`Hello, ${name}`);
};
```

### Run the worker

(Make sure you're in the folder that contains the `tasks/` folder.)

```
npx graphile-worker -c "my_db"
# or, if you have a remote database, something like:
#   npx graphile-worker -c "postgres://user:pass@host:port/db?ssl=1"
# or, if you prefer envvars
#   DATABASE_URL="..." npx graphile-worker
```

(Note: `npx` runs the local copy of an npm module if it is installed, when
you're ready, switch to using the `package.json` `"scripts"` entry instead.)

### Schedule a job:

Connect to your database and run the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT graphile_worker.add_job('hello', json_build_object('name', 'Bobby Tables'));
```

### Success!

You should see the worker output `Hello, Bobby Tables`. Gosh, that was fast!

## Quickstart: library

Instead of running `graphile-worker` via the CLI, you may use it directly in your Node.js code:

```js
const { run } = require("graphile-worker");

async function main() {
  const runner = await run({
    connectionString: "postgres:///",
    concurrency: 5,
    pollInterval: 1000,
    // you can set the taskList or taskDirectory but not both
    taskList: {
      testTask: async (payload, helpers) => {
        helpers.logger.debug("working on task...");
      },
    },
    // or:
    //   taskDirectory: `${__dirname}/tasks`,
  });
}

main().catch(err => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

You can then add jobs with the `addJob` method:

```js
await runner.addJob("testTask", {
  thisIsThePayload: true,
});
```

And stop the job runner with `runner.stop()`.

## Crowd-funded open-source software

Please support development of this project [via
sponsorship](https://graphile.org/sponsor/). With your support we can improve
performance, usability and documentation at a greater rate, leading to reduced
running and engineering costs for your organisation, leading to a net ROI.

Support contracts are also available; for more information see: https://www.graphile.org/support/

## Features

- Standalone and embedded modes
- Easy to test with (including `runTaskListOnce` util)
- Low latency (~2ms from task schedule to execution, uses `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` to be informed of jobs as they're inserted)
- High performance (~700 jobs per second on a single node, uses `SKIP LOCKED` to find jobs to execute, resulting in faster fetches)
- Small tasks (uses explicit task names / payloads resulting in minimal serialisation/deserialisation overhead)
- Parallel by default
- Adding jobs to same named queue runs them in series
- Automatically re-attempts failed jobs with exponential back-off
- Customisable retry count (default: 25 attempts over ~3 days)
- Open source
- Executes tasks written in Node.js (can call out to any other language or networked service)
- Modern JS with async/await
- Watch mode for development (experimental - iterate your jobs without restarting worker)

## Status

Solid test suite testing internals, but external interfaces need tests to
prevent regressions (get in touch if you'd like to help with this!). This
specific codebase is young, but it's based on years of implementing similar job
queues for Postgres. To give feedback please raise an issue or reach out on
discord: http://discord.gg/graphile

## Requirements

PostgreSQL 10+\* and Node 10+\*.

If your database doesn't already include the `pgcrypto` extension
we'll automatically install it into the public schema for you. If the
extension is installed in a different schema (unlikely) you may face issues.
Making alias functions in the public schema, should solve this issue (see issue [#43](https://github.com/graphile/worker/issues/43) for an example).

\* Might work with older versions, but has not been tested.

## Installation

```
yarn add graphile-worker
# or: npm install --save graphile-worker
```

## Running

`graphile-worker` manages it's own database schema (`graphile_worker`). Just
point graphile-worker at your database and we handle our own migrations:

```
npx graphile-worker -c "postgres://localhost/mydb"
```

(`npx` looks for the `graphile-worker` binary locally; it's often better to
use the `"scripts"` entry in `package.json` instead.)

The following CLI options are available:

```
Options:
  --help            Show help                                          [boolean]
  --version         Show version number                                [boolean]
  --connection, -c  Database connection string, defaults to the 'DATABASE_URL'
                    envvar                                              [string]
  --schema-only     Just install (or update) the database schema, then exit
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  --once            Run until there are no runnable jobs left, then exit
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  --watch, -w       [EXPERIMENTAL] Watch task files for changes, automatically
                    reloading the task code without restarting worker
                                                      [boolean] [default: false]
  --jobs, -j        number of jobs to run concurrently              [default: 1]
  --poll-interval   how long to wait between polling for jobs in milliseconds
                    (for jobs scheduled in the future/retries)
                                                        [number] [default: 2000]
```

## Library usage

`graphile-worker` can be used as a library inside your Node.js application. It exposes the `run(options)` and `runOnce(options)` functions.

`run(options)` will run until either stopped by a signal event like `SIGINT` or by calling the `stop()` function on the object returned by `run()`.

`runOnce(options)` is the equivalent of running the cli with the `--once` option. The function will run until there are no runnable jobs left.

`runMigrations(options)` is the equivalent of running the cli with the `--schema-only` option. Runs the migrations and then returns.

The following options for these methods are available.

- `concurrency`: The equivalent of the cli `--jobs` option with the same default value.
- `pollInterval`: The equivalent of the cli `--poll-interval` option with the same default value.
- `logger`: To change how log messages are output you may provide a custom logger; see `logger` below
- the database is identified through one of these options:
  - `connectionString`: A PostgreSQL connection string to the database containing the job queue, or
  - `pgPool`: A `pg.Pool` instance to use
- the tasks to execute are identified through one of these options:
  - `taskDirectory`: A path string to a directory containing the task handlers.
  - `taskList`: An object with the task names as keys and a corresponding task handler functions as values

Exactly one of either `taskDirectory` or `taskList` must be provided (except for `runMigrations` which doesn't require a task list).

Either `connectionString` or `pgPool` must be provided, or the `DATABASE_URL`
envvar must be set.

**Example**

```js
const { Pool } = require("pg");
const { run } = require("graphile-worker");

const pgPool = new Pool({
  connectionString: "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres",
});

async function main() {
  const runner = await run({
    pgPool,
    // or: connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,

    concurrency: 1,
    pollInterval: 2000,

    taskList: {
      testTask: async (payload, helpers) => {
        helpers.logger.debug(`Received ${JSON.stringify(payload)}`);
      },
    },
    // or: taskDirectory: `${__dirname}/tasks`,
  });
  // to clean up: runner.stop()
}

main().catch(err => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

### The logger option

You may customise where log messages from graphile-worker (and your tasks) go by supplying a custom `Logger` instance using your own `logFactory`.

```js
const { Logger, run } = require("graphile-worker");

/* Replace this function with your own implementation */
function logFactory(scope) {
  return (level, message, meta) => {
    console.log(level, message, scope, meta);
  };
}

const logger = new Logger(logFactory);

// Pass the logger to the 'run' method as part of options:
run({
  logger,
  /* pgPool, taskList, etc... */
});
```

Your `logFactory` function will be passed a scope object which may contain the following keys (all optional):

- `label` (string): a rough description of the type of action ('watch', 'worker' and 'job' are the currently used values).
- `workerId` (string): the ID of the worker instance
- `taskIdentifier` (string): the task name (identifier) of the running job
- `jobId` (number): the id of the running job

And it should return a logger function which will receive these three arguments:

- `level` ('error', 'warning', 'info' or 'debug') - severity of the log message
- `message` (string) - the log message itself
- `meta` (optional object) - may contain other useful metadata, useful in structured logging systems

The return result of the logger function is currently ignored; but we strongly recommend that for future compatibility you do not return anything from your logger function.

See `consoleLogFactory` in [src/logger.ts](src/logger.ts) for an example logFactory.

**NOTE**: you do not need to (and should not) customise, inherit or extend the `Logger` class at all.

## Creating task executors

A task executor is a simple async JS function which receives as input the job
payload and a collection of helpers. It does the work and then returns. If it
returns then the job is deemed a success and is deleted from the queue. If it
throws an error then the job is deemed a failure and the task is rescheduled
using an exponential-backoff algorithm.

**IMPORTANT**: your jobs should wait for all asynchronous work to be completed
before returning, otherwise we might mistakenly think they were successful.

**IMPORTANT**: we automatically retry the job if it fails, so it's often
sensible to split large jobs into smaller jobs, this also allows them to run
in parallel resulting in faster execution. This is particularly important
for tasks that are not idempotent (i.e. running them a second time will
have extra side effects) - for example sending emails.

Tasks are created in the `tasks` folder in the directory from which you run
`graphile-worker`; the name of the file (less the `.js` suffix) is used as
the task identifier. Currently only `.js` files that can be directly loaded
by Node.js are supported; if you are using Babel, TypeScript or similar you
will need to compile your tasks into the `tasks` folder.

```
current directory
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â””â”€â”€ tasks
    â”œâ”€â”€ task_1.js
    â””â”€â”€ task_2.js
```

```js
// tasks/task_1.js
module.exports = async payload => {
  await doMyLogicWith(payload);
};
```

```js
// tasks/task_2.js
module.exports = async (payload, helpers) => {
  // async is optional, but best practice
  helpers.logger.debug(`Received ${JSON.stringify(payload)}`);
};
```

Each task function is passed two arguments:

- `payload` - the payload you passed when calling `add_job`
- `helpers` - an object containing:
  - `logger` - a scoped Logger instance, to aid tracing/debugging
  - `job` - the whole job (including `uuid`, `attempts`, etc) - you shouldn't need this
  - `withPgClient` - a helper to use to get a database client
  - `query(sql, values)` - a convenience wrapper for `withPgClient(pgClient => pgClient.query(sql, values))`
  - `addJob` - a helper to schedule a job

### helpers

#### `helpers.logger`

So that you may redirect logs to your preferred logging provider, we have
enabled you to supply your own logging provider. Overriding this is currently
only available in library mode. We then wrap this logging provider with a
helper class to ease debugging; the helper class has the following methods:

- `error(message, meta?)`: for logging errors, similar to `console.error`
- `warn(message, meta?)`: for logging warnings, similar to `console.warn`
- `info(message, meta?)`: for logging informational messages, similar to `console.info`
- `debug(message, meta?)`: to aid with debugging, similar to `console.log`
- `scope(additionalScope)`: returns a new `Logger` instance with additional scope information

#### `helpers.withPgClient(callback)`

`withPgClient` gets a `pgClient` from the pool, calls `await callback(pgClient)`, and finally releases the client and returns the result of
`callback`. This workflow makes testing your tasks easier.

Example:

```js
const {
  rows: [row],
} = await withPgClient(pgClient => pgClient.query("select 1 as one"));
```

#### `helpers.addJob(identifier, payload?, options?)`

Schedules a job; arguments:

- `identifier`: the name of the task to be executed
- `payload`: an optional JSON-compatible object to give the task more context on what it is doing
- `options`: an optional object specifying:
  - `queueName`: the queue to run this task under
  - `runAt`: a Date to schedule this task to run in the future
  - `maxAttempts`: how many retries should this task get? (Default: 25)

Example:

```js
await addJob("task_2", { foo: "bar" });
```

## Scheduling jobs

You can schedule jobs directly in the database, e.g. from a trigger or
function, or by calling SQL from your application code. You do this using the
`graphile_worker.add_job` function. (We'll add a JS helper for this soon...)

`add_job` accepts the following parameters (in this order):

- `identifier` - the only **required** field, indicates the name of the task executor to run (omit the `.js` suffix!)
- `payload` - a JSON object with information to tell the task executor what to do (defaults to an empty object)
- `queue_name` - if you want certain tasks to run one at a time, add them to the same named queue (defaults to a random value)
- `run_at` - a timestamp after which to run the job; defaults to now.
- `max_attempts` - if this task fails, how many times should we retry it? Default: 25.

Typically you'll want to set the `identifier` and `payload`:

```sql
SELECT graphile_worker.add_job(
  'send_email',
  json_build_object(
    'to', 'someone@example.com',
    'subject', 'graphile-worker test'
  )
);
```

You can skip parameters you don't need by using PostgreSQL's named parameter support:

```sql
SELECT graphile_worker.add_job('reminder', run_at := NOW() + INTERVAL '2 days');
```

**NOTE:** `graphile_worker.add_job(...)` requires database owner privileges
to execute. To allow lower-privileged users to call it, wrap it inside a
PostgreSQL function marked as `SECURITY DEFINER` so that it will run
with the same privileges as the more powerful user that defined it. (Be
sure that this function performs any access checks that are necessary.)

### Example: scheduling job from trigger

This snippet creates a trigger function which adds a job to execute
`task_identifier_here` when a new row is inserted into `my_table`.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION my_table_created() RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM graphile_worker.add_job('task_identifier_here', json_build_object('id', NEW.id));
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE;

CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name AFTER INSERT ON my_table FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE my_table_created();
```

### Example: one trigger function to rule them all

If your tables are all defined with a single primary key named `id` then you
can define a more convenient dynamic trigger function which can be called from
multiple triggers for multiple tables to quickly schedule jobs.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION trigger_job() RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  PERFORM graphile_worker.add_job(TG_ARGV[0], json_build_object(
    'schema', TG_TABLE_SCHEMA,
    'table', TG_TABLE_NAME,
    'op', TG_OP,
    'id', (CASE WHEN TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN OLD.id ELSE NEW.id END)
  ));
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE;
```

You might use this trigger like this:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER send_verification_email
  AFTER INSERT ON user_emails
  FOR EACH ROW
  WHEN (NEW.verified is false)
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE trigger_job('send_verification_email');
CREATE TRIGGER user_changed
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON users
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE trigger_job('user_changed');
CREATE TRIGGER generate_pdf
  AFTER INSERT ON pdfs
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE trigger_job('generate_pdf');
CREATE TRIGGER generate_pdf_update
  AFTER UPDATE ON pdfs
  FOR EACH ROW
  WHEN (NEW.title IS DISTINCT FROM OLD.title)
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE trigger_job('generate_pdf');
```

## Uninstallation

To delete the worker code and all the tasks from your database, just run this one SQL statement:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA graphile_worker CASCADE;
```

## Performance

`graphile-worker` is not intended to replace extremely high performance
dedicated job queues, it's intended to be a very easy way to get a job queue
up and running with Node.js and PostgreSQL. But this doesn't mean it's a
slouch by any means - it achieves an average latency from triggering a job in
one process to executing it in another of just 2ms, and each worker can
handle up to 731 jobs per second on modest hardware (2011 iMac).

`graphile-worker` is horizontally scalable. Each instance has a customisable
worker pool, this pool defaults to size 1 (only one job at a time on this
worker) but depending on the nature of your tasks (i.e. assuming they're not
compute-heavy) you will likely want to set this higher to benefit from
Node.js' concurrency. If your tasks are compute heavy you may still wish to
set it higher and then using Node's `child_process` (or Node v11's
`worker_threads`) to share the compute load over multiple cores without
significantly impacting the main worker's runloop.

To test performance you can run `yarn perfTest`. This reveals that on a 2011
iMac running both the worker and the database (and a bunch of other stuff)
starting the command, checking for jobs, and exiting takes about 0.40s and
running 20,000 [trivial](perfTest/tasks/log_if_999.js) queued jobs across a
single worker pool of size 1 takes 27.35s (~731 jobs per second). Latencies
are also measured, from before the call to queue the job is fired until when
the job is actually executed. These latencies ranged from 1.39ms to 19.66ms
with an average of 1.90ms.

## Exponential-backoff

We currently use the formula `exp(least(10, attempt))` to determine the
delays between attempts (the job must fail before the next attempt is
scheduled, so the total time elapsed may be greater depending on how long the
job runs for before it fails). This seems to handle temporary issues well,
after ~4 hours attempts will be made every ~6 hours until the maximum number
of attempts is achieved. The specific delays can be seen below:

```
select
  attempt,
  exp(least(10, attempt)) * interval '1 second' as delay,
  sum(exp(least(10, attempt)) * interval '1 second') over (order by attempt asc) total_delay
from generate_series(1, 24) as attempt;

 attempt |      delay      |   total_delay
