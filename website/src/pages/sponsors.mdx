As well as ensuring the sustainability and longevity of Graphile Worker and the
wider Graphile suite of developer tooling, sponsorship also gives you or your
company some additional benefits such as access to security announcements and
being featured in the README files of Graphile’s main open source projects.

## Why are Graphile projects &ldquo;crowd-funded open-source&rdquo;?

Many of our projects are open-source under the permissive MIT license to give
users great freedom in how they use the software, and to enable the community to
have influence over how the projects progress to make it appropriate for a wide
range of use-cases. To ensure users can rely on these projects for years to
come, they need to be well directed and financially sustainable.

**The best way to ensure that Graphile software is something you can depend on
for years to come is through monthly sponsorship.** Crowd-sourced funding
enables us to spend the most time directly working on improving the software,
which you and other users then benefit from.
