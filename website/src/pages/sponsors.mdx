Graphile has a number of crowd-funded open-source projects, licensed under the
permissive MIT license, including Graphile Worker, PostGraphile,
Gra<em>fast</em>, Graphile Migrate and Graphile Starter. Sponsorship increases
the rate of fixes, documentation improvements, and feature development on these
and other projects.

## Why are Graphile projects &ldquo;crowd-funded open-source&rdquo;?

Many of our projects are open-source to give users great freedom in how they use
the software, and to enable the community to have influence over how the
projects progress to make it appropriate for a wide range of use-cases. To
ensure users can rely on these projects for years to come, they need to be well
directed and financially sustainable.

**The best way to ensure that Graphile software is something you can depend on
for years to come is through monthly sponsorship.** Crowd-sourced funding
enables us to spend the most time directly working on improving the software,
which you and other users then benefit from.

## Sponsor tiers &amp; benefits

As well as ensuring the sustainability and longevity of Graphile Worker and the
wider Graphile suite of developer tooling, sponsorship also gives you or your
company some additional benefits such as access to security announcements and
being featured in the README files of Graphile’s main open source projects.
Choose the tier which matches your funding goal, higher tiers come with more
benefits.

## Development Support

Access development support for Graphile projects through the Private Advisor
tier, giving your organization access to the knowledge and experience of the
Graphile team for any issues you have with Graphile Worker, PostGraphile and the
wider Graphile suite, and other tools in the ecosystem such as TypeScript, SQL,
Node.js, GraphQL and more. If you’re running any of the Graphile tools, you
won’t find anyone more qualified to help.
