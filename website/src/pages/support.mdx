## Graphile projects are &ldquo;crowd-funded open-source&rdquo;

Many of our projects are open-source to give users great freedom in how they use
the software, and to enable the community to have influence over how the
projects progress to make it appropriate for a wide range of use-cases. To
ensure users can rely on these projects for years to come, they need to be well
directed and financially sustainable.

**The best way to ensure that Graphile software is something you can depend on
for years to come is through monthly sponsorship.** Crowd-sourced funding
enables us to spend the most time directly working on improving the software,
which you and other users then benefit from.
