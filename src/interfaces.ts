/*
 * Terminology:
 *
 * - job: an entry in the `jobs` table, representing work to be done
 * - queue: an entry in the `job_queues` table, representing a list of jobs to be executed sequentially
 * - task_identifier: the name of the task to be executed to complete the job
 * - task: a function representing code to be executed for a particular job (identified by the task_identifier); i.e. a file in the `tasks/` folder
 * - task list: an object collection of named tasks
 * - watched task list: an abstraction for a task list that can be updated when the tasks on the disk change
 * - worker: the thing that checks out a job from the database, executes the relevant task, and then returns the job to the database with either success or failure
 * - worker pool: a collection of workers to enable processing multiple jobs in parallel
 * - runner: the thing responsible for building a task list and running a worker pool for said list
